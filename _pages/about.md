I am a PhD candidate in Decision, Risk and Operations at Columbia University, where I am fortunate to be advised by Professor Omar Besbes and Professor Ilan Lobel from NYU-Stern. I am interested in online optimization, decision-making, and learning in complex environments such as online platforms and marketplaces. I love to chat about innovation, entrepreneurship, and explore how machine learning methods can be leveraged to tackle operational challenges.
