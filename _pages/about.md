Hi, welcome to my academic website. I’m an Assistant Professor in the Operations and Technology Group at the UCL School of Management. My research focuses on improving decision-making in complex, data-rich environments such as digital platforms and marketplaces, using tools from online optimization, statistical learning, and decision theory. My work has appeared in Operations Research and been presented at NeurIPS, COLT, and ACM EC. I’m passionate about innovation, entrepreneurship, and applying research to real-world challenges.

Before joining UCL, I earned a PhD in Decision, Risk & Operations at Columbia University, advised by Omar Besbes, Ilan Lobel, and Fanyin Zheng, and completed a postdoctoral position at Stanford University with Daniela Saban, also collaborating with Vahideh Manshadi from Yale.

Alongside my academic career, I co-founded CashU, a Brazilian fintech transforming B2B credit in supply chains, where I apply data science and optimization to improve access to finance for SMEs. I also hold a PhD in Materials Science and founded ProtMat, a digital dentistry company focused on advanced biomaterials.
